1
00:00:03,243 --> 00:00:06,203
22 players arrived
at this Scottish castle

2
00:00:06,243 --> 00:00:08,963
to play the ultimate
murder mystery game,

3
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:12,883
in the hope of winning up to
£120,000.

4
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:17,363
But concealed amongst them
are the Traitors,

5
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:21,603
who will secretly murder their
fellow players at night.

6
00:00:21,643 --> 00:00:25,563
It's up to the Faithful to work
out who the Traitors are...

7
00:00:25,603 --> 00:00:26,763
<font color="#ffff00">Are you a Traitor?</font>

8
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:28,723
..and banish them from the game...

9
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:31,003
<font color="#00ffff">You know what?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I think YOU'RE a Traitor.</font>

10
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:32,243
<font color="#00ff00">That is mad.</font>

11
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,483
..because if a Traitor remains
undetected...

12
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:35,883
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, my God!</font>

13
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:37,123
<font color="#00ffff">I would never have guessed her!</font>

14
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,963
..they take all the money.

15
00:00:41,243 --> 00:00:45,763
..three traitors were selected,
but there was a surprise twist.

16
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:46,323
..three traitors were selected,
but there was a surprise twist.

17
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:50,963
The Traitor selection is not
quite complete.

18
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:55,203
Traitors, you will enlist
the final member.

19
00:00:55,243 --> 00:00:57,923
So the Traitors had a big
decision to make.

20
00:00:57,963 --> 00:00:59,443
<font color="#ffff00">So, Andrew is one.</font>

21
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:03,403
<font color="#ffff00">We've got Miles...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Sonja.</font> <font color="#ffff00">..Sonja and Diane.</font>

22
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:05,483
It's you.

23
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,043
As the prize pot started building...

24
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,003
CHEERING

25
00:01:10,043 --> 00:01:12,003
..so did suspicions.

26
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:13,723
<font color="#00ffff">I heard you had problems</font>
<font color="#00ffff">on your boat.</font>

27
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:15,843
<font color="#00ff00">What bird told you that we had</font>
<font color="#00ff00">problems on the boat?</font>

28
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:19,083
<font color="#ffff00">Did you panic under the blindfold?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">No, I was straight...</font> <font color="#00ffff">That was me.</font>

29
00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:21,243
<font color="#ffff00">Ross heard somebody say,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">"I'll sleep easy tonight."</font>

30
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:23,323
<font color="#00ffff">I'm not sure what angle</font>
<font color="#00ffff">she was trying to get at.</font>

31
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:25,643
And the Traitors were about to
meet with their new recruit

32
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:27,803
for the very first time.

33
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:31,243
You are now officially a Traitor.

34
00:01:31,283 --> 00:01:33,563
<font color="#00ffff">I know that we've made</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the right choice.</font>

35
00:01:33,603 --> 00:01:35,483
This is The Traitors.

36
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:56,883
# This is the darkness inside... #

37
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,963
KNOCK ON DOOR

38
00:02:06,443 --> 00:02:09,723
# ..This is the darkness inside... #

39
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:27,843
<font color="#00ffff">I'm a Traitor.</font>

40
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:31,483
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah! Ah! Crazy.</font>

41
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:38,603
HE GASPS

42
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,603
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my God!</font>

43
00:02:41,643 --> 00:02:43,243
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome to the dark side.</font>

44
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:46,203
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my God!</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Baffled, absolutely baffled.</font>

45
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:49,083
<font color="#00ffff">Had no idea it would be those three</font>

46
00:02:49,123 --> 00:02:50,523
<font color="#00ffff">who's chosen me.</font>

47
00:02:50,563 --> 00:02:51,643
<font color="#00ffff">So, yeah...</font>

48
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:54,603
<font color="#00ffff">Blown.</font>

49
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:56,483
<font color="#ffff00">And you were top.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Oh, really?</font>

50
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:58,603
<font color="#ffff00">You were right at the top.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Really?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

51
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:02,363
<font color="#ffff00">Miles being brought in has</font>
<font color="#ffff00">strengthened us</font>

52
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:05,203
<font color="#ffff00">an unbelievable amount.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">He's a big personality,</font>

53
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:06,443
<font color="#ffff00">strong-willed,</font>

54
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:09,683
<font color="#ffff00">but he's also fiercely loyal.</font>

55
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,643
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my God, I can't believe it!</font>

56
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:14,243
<font color="#00ff00">Did you suspect anything?</font>

57
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:16,643
<font color="#00ffff">No, no, no, none of you.</font> <font color="#ffff00">Really?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">None of you.</font>

58
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:18,563
<font color="#00ffff">It puts me in the game, I'm excited.</font>

59
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:21,843
<font color="#00ffff">I want to be the last man standing</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and have all the money. Game on.</font>

60
00:03:23,883 --> 00:03:27,243
<font color="#00ff00">Now that you're here,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">got a little job to do, innit?</font>

61
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:29,203
<font color="#00ffff">Ah, oh, my gosh.</font>

62
00:03:30,603 --> 00:03:34,043
<font color="#00ff00">So the people who won a Shield</font>
<font color="#00ff00">tonight, obviously Kyra, Jaz,</font>

63
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,043
<font color="#00ff00">and somehow I've won</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a Shield as well.</font> <font color="#ffff00">Wonderful.</font>

64
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,363
<font color="#00ff00">Like a proper traitor, snake-style.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

65
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:41,483
<font color="#00ff00">So, obviously,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">they're off the table.</font>

66
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:42,843
<font color="#00ffff">Mm-hm.</font>

67
00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:44,563
<font color="#ffff00">Do you want to know a name</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I was thinking?</font>

68
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:46,203
<font color="#ffff00">Ants.</font>

69
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:48,563
<font color="#00ff00">He got a bit spiky before.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">He did.</font>

70
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,243
<font color="#00ff00">He switched on Zack.</font>

71
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:51,763
<font color="#00ffff">You've got to remember as well,</font>

72
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:53,803
<font color="#00ffff">that you - people who will</font>
<font color="#00ffff">banish themselves.</font>

73
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:56,283
<font color="#00ffff">I think with, you know, him</font>
<font color="#00ffff">kicking off with Zack and whatnot,</font>

74
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:58,323
<font color="#00ffff">that potentially might spiral.</font>

75
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,603
<font color="#00ffff">He's definitely on the</font>
<font color="#00ffff">chopping block.</font>

76
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,763
<font color="#00ff00">Who's off the table?</font>

77
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:06,323
<font color="#00ff00">Something weird that happened</font>
<font color="#00ff00">this morning. Sonja.</font>

78
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:08,203
<font color="#00ffff">Really?</font> <font color="#ffff00">Yeah, I know.</font>

79
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:09,563
<font color="#00ff00">At the breakfast table,</font>

80
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:12,843
<font color="#00ff00">and she's like, "Are YOU a traitor?"</font>
<font color="#00ff00">And she started laughing.</font>

81
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:14,643
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, really?</font>

82
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:16,363
<font color="#00ff00">I, I honestly believe she's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">harmless.</font>

83
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:17,923
<font color="#00ff00">No, no, no, no, no.</font>

84
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:20,603
<font color="#ffff00">Sonja has got a big following.</font>

85
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:25,683
<font color="#00ff00">This evening, Aubrey also was like,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">"Oh, I have suspicions."</font>

86
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:25,963
<font color="#00ff00">This evening, Aubrey also was like,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">"Oh, I have suspicions."</font>

87
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:28,443
<font color="#00ffff">Aubrey watches from a distance.</font>

88
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:30,243
<font color="#00ffff">He's been on a game plan</font>
<font color="#00ffff">since day one.</font>

89
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:32,603
<font color="#00ffff">I think he's purposely kept</font>
<font color="#00ffff">himself separate.</font>

90
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:35,483
<font color="#00ff00">This is what we don't want,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">is the separate groups.</font>

91
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:38,163
<font color="#ffff00">Diane, you kind of feel like</font>
<font color="#ffff00">she suspects you</font>

92
00:04:38,203 --> 00:04:40,243
<font color="#ffff00">when she's even just stood there.</font>

93
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,563
<font color="#ffff00">So if she has got a bee in her</font>
<font color="#ffff00">bonnet about you,</font>

94
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:44,763
<font color="#ffff00">then she can start spreading</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it around.</font>

95
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:48,163
<font color="#00ff00">The message we should try</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and send is that no-one's safe.</font>

96
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:50,923
<font color="#ffff00">So who are we going to murder?</font>

97
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:55,123
<font color="#ffff00">OK, so it's between Diane...</font>

98
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:57,563
<font color="#ffff00">..Aubrey...</font>

99
00:04:57,603 --> 00:05:00,403
<font color="#ffff00">..and Sonja.</font>

100
00:05:00,443 --> 00:05:05,003
# I, I just died in your arms
tonight... #

101
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:05,563
# I, I just died in your arms
tonight... #

102
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:09,523
<font color="#00ff00">I think it's the best choice</font>
<font color="#00ff00">we could have made.</font>

103
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:10,843
<font color="#ffff00">It's a great move.</font>

104
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:13,203
<font color="#00ff00">Happy murdering.</font>

105
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:14,683
<font color="#00ff00">Feels so good, doesn't it?</font>

106
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:16,123
<font color="#00ffff">Wow!</font>

107
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:23,043
# ..I just died in your arms tonight

108
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,283
# ..I just died in your arms tonight

109
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:31,563
# It must have been something
you said... #

110
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:32,563
# It must have been something
you said... #

111
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:57,563
Last night, the Traitors
committed their first murder,

112
00:05:57,603 --> 00:06:00,843
but which Faithful didn't make it
through the night?

113
00:06:00,883 --> 00:06:04,643
This morning, the surviving players
will make their way to breakfast,

114
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:07,843
but one Faithful won't be
arriving at the castle

115
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:12,043
and currently, only the Traitors
know who that is.

116
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,883
# Cos nobody loves me

117
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:17,363
# It's true

118
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:21,963
# Not like you do... #

119
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:25,843
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, there's no-one in here.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, there's nobody here!</font>

120
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:27,883
<font color="#00ffff">It's just us.</font> <font color="#ffff00">Ah!</font>

121
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:29,243
<font color="#ffff00">We came down for breakfast,</font>

122
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:32,243
<font color="#ffff00">one of the first ones in,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">which was strange.</font>

123
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:33,923
<font color="#00ffff">My God, that's so weird, isn't it?</font>

124
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:36,123
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, we've got to sit</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and watch everyone come in now.</font>

125
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:39,363
<font color="#ffff00">Where shall we sit?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Wherever there's food.</font>

126
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:42,083
<font color="#ffff00">We are new to the whole</font>
<font color="#ffff00">murdering scene,</font>

127
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:44,283
<font color="#ffff00">so it's very nerve-racking,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it really is.</font>

128
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:46,883
<font color="#00ffff">Who do you think's got murdered?</font>

129
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:48,763
<font color="#ffff00">I have no idea, to be honest.</font>

130
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:50,483
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>
KNOCK ON DOOR

<font color="#ffff00">to be?</font> <font color="#00ffff">Come in!</font>

134
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,203
<font color="#00ffff">We're all alive!</font>

135
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:04,843
<font color="#00ffff">Going into that breakfast,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it was...</font>

136
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,683
<font color="#00ffff">elation.</font>

137
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:08,683
<font color="#00ffff">I was convinced that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I was up for the chop.</font>

138
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:11,883
<font color="#00ffff">Cos I'm a Christian, so I was like,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">"Please!" I mean,</font>

139
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:15,163
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know whether God really</font>
<font color="#00ffff">watches The Traitors, but...</font>

140
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:18,523
<font color="#00ff00">I'm sure he does, or she.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Or she!</font> <font color="#00ff00">Yeah, he or she.</font>

141
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,603
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font> <font color="#ffff00">I feel like I can,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">like, relax into breakfast now,</font>

142
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:22,803
<font color="#ffff00">I can eat and that's it.</font>

143
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,763
<font color="#ffff00">But then, like, it only lasts</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for a second</font>

144
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:27,163
<font color="#ffff00">and then it's like, "Who's not</font>
<font color="#ffff00">going to come through the door?"</font>

145
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:29,163
KNOCK ON DOOR

148
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:37,723
ALL GREET EACH OTHER

149
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:41,763
<font color="#00ff00">Hello, everyone. I would say hi.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Hi.</font> <font color="#00ffff">How are you?</font>

150
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:44,723
<font color="#00ff00">As a Traitor, breakfast is the</font>
<font color="#00ff00">hardest thing cos like,</font>

151
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,523
<font color="#00ff00">for me, I know who I'm going to see,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I know who's there.</font>

152
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:48,243
<font color="#ffff00">How did you guys sleep?</font>

153
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:51,003
<font color="#00ffff">Not very good,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I kept thinking I was going to die.</font>

154
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:52,843
<font color="#00ff00">I was still really nervous</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and stuff,</font>

155
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:54,363
<font color="#00ff00">but I sort of knew all was good.</font>

156
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:56,243
<font color="#ffff00">Of course, yeah,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you had the Shield, yeah.</font>

157
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:58,203
<font color="#00ff00">But I still felt like,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">heart beating.</font>

158
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:00,243
<font color="#00ff00">It's like heart beating as in,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">someone's going.</font>

159
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:01,563
<font color="#ffff00">You just can't relax.</font>

160
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:02,603
<font color="#00ff00">So my plan is to</font>

161
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:04,243
<font color="#00ff00">genuinely believe I'm a Faithful</font>

162
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,123
<font color="#00ff00">cos if you believe that lie,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">it becomes the truth.</font>

163
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:09,483
<font color="#00ffff">Are you suspecting anyone yet?</font>

164
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:12,323
<font color="#00ff00">It sounds stupid but like, Zack,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">just because, at that table,</font>

165
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:15,163
<font color="#00ff00">you could hear him laughing,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">then as soon as we took 'em off,</font>

166
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,123
<font color="#00ff00">it was like,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">something had happened, you know?</font>

167
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,243
<font color="#00ff00">But if I look at everyone else,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I've got nothing.</font>

168
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,203
<font color="#00ffff">I've got nothing either.</font>
KNOCK ON DOOR

<font color="#00ff00">It's good to see you! See?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Nothing to worry about.</font>

174
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,723
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my heart's pounding</font>
<font color="#00ffff">out my chest.</font>

175
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:41,283
<font color="#00ffff">Anxiety at the first</font>
<font color="#00ffff">breakfast was high.</font>

176
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:44,043
<font color="#00ffff">Obviously, I'm the new recruit,</font>

177
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,963
<font color="#00ffff">so I'm really in unknown territory</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at the moment.</font>

178
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:48,763
<font color="#00ffff">So who are we expecting?</font>

179
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:50,403
<font color="#00ff00">There's actually quite a few,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">isn't there?</font>

180
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:53,203
KNOCK ON DOOR

CHEERING

183
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:07,523
<font color="#ffff00">My whole thought process is</font>
<font color="#ffff00">perfecting walking in for breakfast.</font>

184
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:11,283
<font color="#ffff00">Hello. Good morning, everyone.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Good morning, mwah!</font>

185
00:09:11,323 --> 00:09:12,843
<font color="#ffff00">Just got to kind of manage the,</font>

186
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:14,683
<font color="#ffff00">"Thought I was going to die,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I've not died."</font>

187
00:09:14,723 --> 00:09:15,923
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, my goodness.</font>

188
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:18,203
<font color="#ffff00">Really happy to see everyone.</font>

189
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:21,203
<font color="#ffff00">So I'm tempted to maybe do</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a watery eye.</font>

190
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:23,683
<font color="#ffff00">Deep breaths, give waves round</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the table</font>

191
00:09:23,723 --> 00:09:25,723
<font color="#ffff00">and take it from there,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">type of thing.</font>

192
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,483
<font color="#00ffff">Right there, when Paul walked in,</font>

193
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:33,483
<font color="#00ffff">he looked genuinely happy</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that he was here.</font>

194
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:36,443
<font color="#00ff00">I don't get a sniff from Paul</font>
<font color="#00ff00">of being a Traitor.</font> <font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

CHEERING

198
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:48,043
<font color="#ffff00">Yes!</font>

199
00:09:49,563 --> 00:09:50,803
<font color="#00ffff">Great to see you.</font>

200

<font color="#00ffff">Hey!</font> <font color="#00ff00">Hi, lovely.</font> <font color="#ffff00">Oh, thank you.</font>

201
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:56,043
<font color="#ffff00">I suppose the surprise is that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you are going in for breakfast,</font>

202
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,483
<font color="#ffff00">so you're not the missing person,</font>

203
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:59,283
<font color="#ffff00">that was good.</font>

204
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:01,723
<font color="#ffff00">Lovely to be back at breakfast</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with everybody.</font>

205
00:10:01,763 --> 00:10:04,243
<font color="#ffff00">Well, not everybody.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Who's not here?</font>

206
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:06,123
<font color="#ffff00">But it takes a bit of working out</font>

207
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:07,323
<font color="#ffff00">about who's there and who isn't.</font>

208
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:09,723
<font color="#ffff00">Diane? Can you see Diane?</font>

209
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:11,123
<font color="#00ffff">I don't.</font>

210
00:10:11,163 --> 00:10:15,603
<font color="#00ffff">So there's Andrew, Zack...</font>

211
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:19,083
<font color="#00ffff">..Aubrey and Diane.</font>

212
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:31,643
<font color="#ffff00">Now we're down to these people</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and they're not at the table.</font>

213
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:36,763
<font color="#00ffff">Like, any of them, I'm going to be,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">like, really gutted.</font>

KNOCK ON DOOR

CHEERING

216

<font color="#00ffff">Aubrey's gone!</font>

217
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:59,603
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, no! It's Aubrey.</font>

218
00:11:00,963 --> 00:11:03,123
<font color="#ffff00">Wow!</font>

219
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,283
<font color="#00ff00">I'm going to put out there, Aubrey.</font>

220
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:14,883
<font color="#00ff00">I feel like it sends a message.</font>

221
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,283
<font color="#00ffff">I think so.</font>

222
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:18,603
<font color="#00ff00">I don't feel like anyone would</font>
<font color="#00ff00">suspect us four right here,</font>

223
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:20,083
<font color="#00ff00">right now, to say Aubrey.</font>

224
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:22,123
<font color="#00ff00">It throws them off our scent.</font>

225
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,443
<font color="#ffff00">Oh!</font>

226
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,923
<font color="#ffff00">"Dear Aubrey, by order of the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Traitors, you have been murdered.</font>

227
00:11:33,963 --> 00:11:36,083
<font color="#ffff00">"Signed, the Traitors."</font>

228
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,923
<font color="#ffff00">I think I've been murdered</font>
<font color="#ffff00">because I'm too observant.</font>

229
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:46,003
<font color="#ffff00">I was a threat to the Traitors</font>

00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:47,443
<font color="#ffff00">I say what I see.</font>

231
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:50,523
<font color="#ffff00">Perhaps I should have kept</font>
<font color="#ffff00">quiet or whatever.</font>

232
00:11:50,563 --> 00:11:53,003
<font color="#ffff00">They've made a big mistake.</font>

233
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,963
<font color="#00ffff">If you think about it, I feel</font>
<font color="#00ffff">like this really makes it real now.</font>

234
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:04,763
<font color="#00ffff">We were afraid of Aubrey, for sure.</font>

235
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:06,323
<font color="#00ffff">It really came down to</font>

236
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,203
<font color="#00ffff">that strong alliance between</font>

237
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:11,043
<font color="#00ffff">Diane, Aubrey and Sonja.</font>

238
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,883
<font color="#00ffff">All three of those people</font>

239
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:16,803
<font color="#00ffff">are not afraid of coming straight</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at you.</font>

240
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:20,563
<font color="#00ffff">We have to take out</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the strongest link first.</font>

241
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:22,683
<font color="#00ffff">That left us with no choice</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but Aubrey.</font>

242
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,643
<font color="#00ff00">I don't understand</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the motive behind it.</font>

243
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:28,283
<font color="#00ffff">Because he sits and watches.</font>

244
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:29,723
<font color="#00ffff">He did sit and watch.</font>

245
00:12:29,763 --> 00:12:31,083
<font color="#00ffff">I am a bit distraught</font>

246
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:32,643
<font color="#00ffff">that Aubrey's gone,</font>

247
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:34,043
<font color="#00ffff">I was very fond of Aubrey.</font>

248
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,363
<font color="#00ffff">I think it was tactical.</font>

249
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:38,843
<font color="#ffff00">But why Aubrey, though?</font> <font color="#00ffff">I don't</font>
<font color="#00ffff">know. Maybe he's not friends</font>

250
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,363
<font color="#00ffff">with him. Maybe whoever sent him</font>
<font color="#00ffff">down wasn't mates with him.</font>

251
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:42,963
<font color="#ffff00">I killed Aubrey,</font>

252
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:45,603
<font color="#ffff00">which felt lovely.</font>

253
00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:48,363
<font color="#ffff00">The nice ones, like,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you get like a sweet taste.</font>

254
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:50,643
<font color="#ffff00">You know, like really rich</font>
<font color="#ffff00">chocolate.</font>

255
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,523
LAUGHS EVILLY

256
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:06,603
Good morning, everyone.

257
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:08,843
<font color="#00ffff">Morning!</font> <font color="#00ff00">Morning!</font>

258
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:11,923
But it isn't everyone, is it?
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font> <font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

259
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:16,923
Aubrey has been killed,
the first person to be murdered.

260
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:17,203
Aubrey has been killed,
the first person to be murdered.

261
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:19,563
But better him than you, eh?

262
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:22,083
Shall we get him down...
Do you mind helping me?

263
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:24,203
Will you get his portrait
down for me?

264
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:26,163
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, go on, Paul.</font>

265
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:30,923
So, Aubrey's been killed

266
00:13:30,963 --> 00:13:34,243
and as is tradition with the first
person murdered...

267
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:36,283
<font color="#00ff00">Oh!</font>

268
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:39,243
Is it real yet?

269
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:41,123
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah, now it is.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, it's so real.</font>

270
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:43,283
Because you're not on holiday.

271
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,683
Tonight is the first banishment
at the Round Table.

272
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:52,003
Faithful, this is your chance
to rid yourself of a Traitor.

273
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:52,683
Faithful, this is your chance
to rid yourself of a Traitor.

274
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:56,123
You need to watch, you need to
listen,

275
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:59,123
you need to take it all in.
Do you understand?

276
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:02,483
The game is now on.

277
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:05,603
Be careful not to ruffle
anyone's feathers.

278
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:10,083
And on that note, I'll see you
shortly outside for today's mission.

279
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:10,483
And on that note, I'll see you
shortly outside for today's mission.

280
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:11,803
<font color="#00ffff">Feathers.</font>

281
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:13,683
<font color="#00ff00">Oh, feathers! Good spot!</font>

282
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:23,563
<font color="#00ffff">I'm going for a coffee.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I'll catch you guys.</font> <font color="#ffff00">All righty.</font>

283
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:24,643
<font color="#00ff00">Where's everyone gone?</font>

284
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:26,563
<font color="#00ff00">Tonight, we have the first</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Round Table.</font>

285
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:28,803
<font color="#00ff00">I feel like it's more pressure</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for the Traitors</font>

286
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:31,003
<font color="#00ff00">cos the truth you're hiding,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">basically.</font>

287
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:33,243
<font color="#00ff00">So my plan today, just chill,</font>

288
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:35,083
<font color="#00ff00">I'm not trying to make everyone</font>
<font color="#00ff00">follow me.</font>

289
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:36,923
<font color="#00ff00">Just look like the good guy,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">basically.</font>

290
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:40,283
<font color="#00ffff">It's getting intense now.</font>

291
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:43,243
<font color="#ffff00">It was a bit overwhelming in there.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">My mind started racing a bit.</font>

292
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,163
<font color="#ffff00">It's tricky.</font> <font color="#00ffff">It really is.</font>

293
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:47,883
<font color="#00ffff">I find it more easier to see</font>
<font color="#00ffff">who's not a...</font>

294
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:49,443
<font color="#00ffff">Who I think is a Faithful,</font>

295
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:51,523
<font color="#00ffff">rather than who's the Traitor</font>
<font color="#00ffff">at this point.</font>

296
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:53,603
<font color="#ffff00">That's, that's a good way</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to tackle it, I guess.</font>

297
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,003
<font color="#00ffff">Because I think, like, there's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a lot of people that I think,</font>

298
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:58,163
<font color="#00ffff">"Yeah, definitely a Faithful."</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Like, Paul,</font>

299
00:14:58,203 --> 00:14:59,683
<font color="#00ffff">definitely a Faithful, I think.</font>

300
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,843
<font color="#00ff00">Now Aubrey's been murdered,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">it's like, OK,</font>

301
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:06,363
<font color="#00ff00">we're playing the game now.</font>

302
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:08,723
<font color="#00ff00">Everyone's brain</font>
<font color="#00ff00">went into gear after that</font>

303
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:11,003
<font color="#00ff00">and speculating had started.</font>

304
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,403
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know what my game plan is?</font>

305
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:14,083
<font color="#ffff00">I'll make it up as I go along.</font>

306
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:15,843
THEY LAUGH

307
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:18,123
<font color="#ffff00">What else are you going to...?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Like, what else can you do?</font>

308
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:20,123
<font color="#00ff00">What game plan can you have,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">coming here?</font>

309
00:15:20,163 --> 00:15:22,403
<font color="#00ffff">You've just got to be yourself,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">unless you're a Traitor</font>

310
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:25,643
<font color="#00ffff">and then you don't want to be</font>
<font color="#00ffff">yourself.</font> <font color="#00ff00">Well, yeah. Yeah.</font>

311
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:31,483
<font color="#00ffff">So what do you do, like? Obviously,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">apart from being a Traitor,</font>

312
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:33,403
<font color="#00ffff">you know what I mean?</font>

313
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:37,043
<font color="#ffff00">I do have a degree, an honours</font>
<font color="#ffff00">degree in social science,</font>

314
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:41,123
<font color="#ffff00">which is the study of how people</font>
<font color="#ffff00">interact in society.</font>

315
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:42,683
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, I like that.</font>

316
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:44,643
<font color="#00ff00">That would be one you would hide,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I would say.</font>

317
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:45,803
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I came here thinking,</font>

318
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:47,443
<font color="#ffff00">"I'm definitely not</font>
<font color="#ffff00">going to say that,"</font>

319
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:50,363
<font color="#ffff00">but I think you're all too nice.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It's probably,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I've probably just gone...</font>

320
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:52,243
<font color="#ffff00">Realising that the first person,</font>

321
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:54,243
<font color="#ffff00">in the morning,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at breakfast, had gone,</font>

322
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:56,483
<font color="#ffff00">did make all conversation change.</font>

323
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,683
<font color="#ffff00">It's not a big, long holiday, this,</font>

324
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:02,003
<font color="#ffff00">I need to get my act together</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and start working out who's who.</font>

325
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:04,723
<font color="#ffff00">Do you do modelling, Mollie?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, I do disability modelling.</font>

326
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,163
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, do you? Really?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, yeah.</font>

327
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:07,403
<font color="#00ffff">How did you get into it?</font>

328
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:10,443
<font color="#00ff00">So, when I was like, younger,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I walked into a shop</font>

329
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:13,123
<font color="#00ff00">and I saw a model and she had one</font>
<font color="#00ff00">arm, and then, from that moment,</font>

330
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:15,523
<font color="#00ff00">I just remember saying to my mum,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">like, the way she made me</font>

331
00:16:15,563 --> 00:16:18,363
<font color="#00ff00">feel, I was like, "I want that to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">be me for, like, other people."</font>

332
00:16:18,403 --> 00:16:21,043
<font color="#00ff00">So I do limb difference</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and then stomas, um...</font>

333
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,363
<font color="#00ffff">What's stoma?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Sorry, I don't know what that is.</font>

334
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:25,723
<font color="#00ff00">When I was 11, I got diagnosed</font>
<font color="#00ff00">with ulcerative colitis</font>

335
00:16:25,763 --> 00:16:27,963
<font color="#00ff00">so they removed my colon.</font>

336
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:31,243
<font color="#00ff00">So I have, like, a bag that, like,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">collects all my waste.</font>

337
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,843
<font color="#00ff00">Obviously, as an 18-year-old,</font>

338
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:35,083
<font color="#00ff00">getting told that you're</font>
<font color="#00ff00">going to have, like, a bag</font>

339
00:16:35,123 --> 00:16:37,683
<font color="#00ff00">stuck to you for the rest of your</font>
<font color="#00ff00">life, you're suddenly thinking,</font>

340
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:39,083
<font color="#00ff00">"Oh, my God, I'm never, like,</font>

341
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,203
<font color="#00ff00">"going to be able to wear</font>
<font color="#00ff00">anything again,</font>

342
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:43,003
<font color="#00ff00">"never be able to go swimming</font>
<font color="#00ff00">again, like,</font>

343
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,403
<font color="#00ff00">"never get a boyfriend again."</font>

344
00:16:44,443 --> 00:16:45,603
<font color="#00ff00">But, yeah, no, I mean,</font>

345
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:48,243
<font color="#00ff00">that's why it was nice doing that</font>
<font color="#00ff00">swimming challenge yesterday.</font>

346
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:49,483
<font color="#00ff00">So that's that.</font>

347
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:54,803
<font color="#00ff00">My head's baffled.</font>

348
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:56,563
<font color="#00ff00">I've heard so much,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">so much bitching.</font>

349
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:59,323
<font color="#ffff00">No, it's a high pressure</font>
<font color="#ffff00">environment, man.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think any...</font>

350
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:01,403
<font color="#ffff00">Nobody's used to it, do you know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">what I mean?</font>

351
00:17:01,443 --> 00:17:03,363
<font color="#ffff00">But you can't help</font>
<font color="#ffff00">but get sucked in, man.</font>

352
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:04,483
<font color="#00ff00">What are you thinking?</font>

353
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,963
<font color="#ffff00">And also, I can't help but say</font>
<font color="#ffff00">my piece, do you know what I mean?</font>

354
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:11,163
<font color="#ffff00">So, had a little situation yesterday</font>
<font color="#ffff00">where Zack said to me and Evie,</font>

355
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:13,803
<font color="#ffff00">he went, "I'm going to sleep</font>
<font color="#ffff00">well tonight, right?"</font>

356
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:15,603
<font color="#ffff00">He just chats shit.</font>

357
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:18,003
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think Zack's a Traitor,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">mate.</font>

358
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:19,883
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think - he's not changed.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Do you not think?</font>

359
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:23,483
<font color="#ffff00">But then me and Evie, in the car,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">brought it up that Zack said this,</font>

360
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:26,803
<font color="#ffff00">but then all of us collectively</font>
<font color="#ffff00">were like, "Oh, but it's just him."</font>

361
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:29,083
<font color="#ffff00">He's smart enough that he</font>
<font color="#ffff00">wouldn't let it slip.</font>

362
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:31,603
<font color="#ffff00">The next thing I know, we're having</font>
<font color="#ffff00">dinner and Sonja's there</font>

363
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:34,203
<font color="#ffff00">going, "Yeah, tell them the thing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that you said about Zack."</font>

364
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:35,643
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm going, "What, that thing</font>

365
00:17:35,683 --> 00:17:37,923
<font color="#ffff00">"that we said we weren't going</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to tell people?"</font>

366
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:40,443
<font color="#00ffff">Ross, that conversation we had</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in the car, somebody saying,</font>

367
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:42,483
<font color="#00ffff">"I'll sleep easy tonight."</font>

368
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:45,403
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, yeah, that was Zacky-boy.</font>

369
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:47,043
<font color="#ffff00">So I'm kind of thinking now,</font>

370
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:50,563
<font color="#ffff00">she's starting to stir the pot</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a little bit.</font>

371
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,043
<font color="#ffff00">She looks like the type,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">doesn't she?</font>

372
00:17:58,523 --> 00:17:59,963
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah.</font>

373
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,083
<font color="#ffff00">Early on in the game,</font>

374
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,683
<font color="#ffff00">when people are looking for any</font>
<font color="#ffff00">little titbit</font>

375
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:07,363
<font color="#ffff00">to, to kind of latch onto,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">when you're seen stirring the pot,</font>

376
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:10,403
<font color="#ffff00">to me, that screams traitorous</font>
<font color="#ffff00">behaviour.</font>

377
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:14,363
<font color="#ffff00">I actually have no other solid</font>
<font color="#ffff00">evidence for anyone else to go off,</font>

378
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:16,283
<font color="#ffff00">so I do think it's Sonja</font>
<font color="#ffff00">at this point in time.</font>

379
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:21,403
<font color="#ffff00">If anybody comes in here,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and I've got a loud voice...</font>

380
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:24,043
<font color="#00ff00">Like, we'll just make up something</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that we're talking about.</font>

381
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,323
<font color="#ffff00">OK.</font>

382
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:27,723
<font color="#ffff00">I don't get on with Anthony.</font>

383
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:29,963
<font color="#ffff00">OK. He doesn't get on with me.</font>

384
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:32,083
<font color="#ffff00">I looked at everybody when they came</font>

385
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:34,763
<font color="#ffff00">and I thought there could</font>
<font color="#ffff00">possibly be people that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">might be able to be a Traitor.</font>

386
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:36,803
<font color="#ffff00">I actually thought you might</font>
<font color="#ffff00">be able to do it.</font> <font color="#00ffff">OK.</font>

387
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:38,883
<font color="#ffff00">Not because I think you're</font>
<font color="#ffff00">horrible or anything,</font>

388
00:18:38,923 --> 00:18:41,563
<font color="#ffff00">cos I thought you'd play</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a good game.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Terrible. Carry on.</font>

389
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:43,923
<font color="#ffff00">Play good games, right?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I agree with you, to be fair.</font>

390
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:46,363
<font color="#ffff00">Anyway, then you watch egos</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and you watch, you know,</font>

391
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:47,803
<font color="#ffff00">the way people behave,</font>

392
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,883
<font color="#ffff00">and the first thing that happened</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to us</font>

393
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:52,003
<font color="#ffff00">when we got in that line</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for Claudia to come out,</font>

394
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,523
<font color="#ffff00">I tried to get in the middle</font>

395
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:55,803
<font color="#ffff00">cos I didn't want to go to one end</font>
<font color="#ffff00">or the other.</font>

396
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,883
<font color="#ffff00">Right, guys, can we move over?</font>

397
00:18:57,923 --> 00:18:59,923
<font color="#00ff00">You can move that way</font>
<font color="#00ff00">if you want to.</font>

398
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:02,083
<font color="#ffff00">No, I'm quite happy to move this</font>
<font color="#ffff00">way, thank you.</font>

399
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:04,283
<font color="#ffff00">And I tried to physically get in.</font>

400
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:06,723
<font color="#ffff00">Anthony was there</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and he wouldn't let me in.</font>

401
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:08,603
<font color="#ffff00">He's got an ego.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">There's the ego, maybe, yeah.</font>

402
00:19:08,643 --> 00:19:11,283
<font color="#ffff00">And I just think he thinks, "That'll</font>
<font color="#ffff00">be good, I could be a Traitor."</font>

403
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:13,283
<font color="#ffff00">Look, anybody could be a Traitor,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">let's face it,</font>

404
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:15,683
<font color="#ffff00">and I could also be sitting chatting</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to people who are Traitors, like,</font>

405
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:17,323
<font color="#ffff00">who I think are really friendly,</font>

406
00:19:17,363 --> 00:19:18,963
<font color="#ffff00">but I will continue to be</font>

407
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:20,603
<font color="#ffff00">suspicious of Anthony.</font>

408
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:22,443
<font color="#ffff00">I think he's putting on a good act</font>

409
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:24,083
<font color="#ffff00">and I think that he could</font>

410
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:25,163
<font color="#ffff00">play a game.</font>

411
00:19:25,203 --> 00:19:29,883
<font color="#00ffff">Anthony and Andrew never chat,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">so are they staying apart?</font>

412
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:31,963
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, I've never seen them,</font>

413
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:33,683
<font color="#00ff00">I've never seen them really chat</font>
<font color="#00ff00">as well.</font>

414
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,683
<font color="#00ffff">I think it's three.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">So do I.</font>

415
00:19:35,723 --> 00:19:38,283
<font color="#ffff00">And your next one's female,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">probably, so go on.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Would be female.</font>

416
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:39,723
<font color="#00ffff">I haven't got a female.</font>

417
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,243
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, you haven't?!</font> <font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

418
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:43,923
<font color="#ffff00">So you haven't noticed a female</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that Anthony chats to?</font>

419
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:45,683
<font color="#00ffff">No. Go on.</font>

420
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:47,643
<font color="#ffff00">Ash.</font>

421
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:48,683
<font color="#00ff00">Really?</font>

422
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:50,363
<font color="#00ffff">Ash.</font> <font color="#ffff00">Mm.</font>

423
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:52,323
<font color="#00ff00">I feel like she just speaks to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">everyone, though.</font>

424
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:54,323
<font color="#00ffff">No, not really.</font> <font color="#ffff00">No, she doesn't.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Does she not?</font> <font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

425
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:56,003
<font color="#00ffff">Diane's already going, you know,</font>

426
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:58,283
<font color="#00ffff">"Ash is kind of someone that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I've got my eye on,"</font>

427
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,763
<font color="#00ffff">and I was thinking,</font>

428
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:01,563
<font color="#00ffff">"You are switched on from,</font>

429
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:05,043
<font color="#00ffff">"like, the start." The fact that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">she was doing that</font>

430
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,323
<font color="#00ffff">is raising concerns.</font>

431
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:18,523
Our players are gathering
for the second mission of the game.

432
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:22,203
This is a chance for both Traitors
and Faithful to work together

433
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:26,203
in order to win money, which will be
added to the final prize pot.

434
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:27,523
Hiya!

435
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:29,323
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, mission time.</font>

436
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:31,363
<font color="#ffff00">I absolutely love the missions.</font>

437
00:20:31,403 --> 00:20:33,643
<font color="#ffff00">It's nice to throw yourself into</font>
<font color="#ffff00">something physical and just have</font>

438
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:34,963
<font color="#ffff00">a break from the think,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">think, think.</font>

439
00:20:35,003 --> 00:20:38,803
<font color="#00ffff">My strategy every mission is</font>
<font color="#00ffff">play like a Faithful,</font>

440
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:40,843
<font color="#00ffff">you look like a Faithful,</font>

441
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:43,323
<font color="#00ffff">you convince everybody</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you're a Faithful.</font>

442
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:48,483
Players, today's mission is
all about communication.

443
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:49,163
Players, today's mission is
all about communication.

444
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:50,563
If you succeed,

445
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:54,043
you could win up to £6,000.

446
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,843
That'll be added to the prize fund.

447
00:20:55,883 --> 00:20:57,163
<font color="#ffff00">Nice!</font> <font color="#00ffff">Ooh!</font>

448
00:20:57,203 --> 00:21:00,803
What I need you to do first
is split into two.

449
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,363
Nine people are in the castle
grounds,

450
00:21:03,403 --> 00:21:07,563
and the rest of you will be
inside the castle.

451
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:09,523
A word of warning.

452
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:14,043
Only the nine who are outside
will have the opportunity to grab

453
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,803
Only the nine who are outside
will have the opportunity to grab

454
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:20,363
a Shield and therefore protect
themselves from tonight's murder.

455
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:20,563
a Shield and therefore protect
themselves from tonight's murder.

456
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:25,923
I need nine here,
the rest of you there. Let's go.

457
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:29,323
<font color="#ffff00">Shall we go for fit people in the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">field?</font> <font color="#00ffff">Shall we go down the middle?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Let's go down the middle?</font>

458
00:21:29,363 --> 00:21:32,363
<font color="#ffff00">To be honest, I think the people</font>
<font color="#ffff00">outside are going to be running</font>
<font color="#ffff00">around.</font> <font color="#00ffff">I can run about.</font>

459
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:34,363
<font color="#ffff00">I think that we say also people who</font>
<font color="#ffff00">haven't had a Shield yet,</font>

460
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:36,803
<font color="#ffff00">maybe stay inside.</font> <font color="#00ffff">I haven't had a</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Shield.</font>

461
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:39,603
<font color="#00ffff">I don't care about the Shield. I</font>
<font color="#00ffff">want to do the mission, guys.</font> <font color="#00ff00">People</font>
<font color="#00ff00">who had a Shield stay inside.</font>

462
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:41,483
<font color="#00ffff">People who had Shields stay inside.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think you should talk</font>

463
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:44,363
<font color="#ffff00">like that. I feel like what's</font>
<font color="#ffff00">people's strengths? Exactly.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It's not about that.</font>

464
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:48,123
<font color="#ffff00">If you're physically fit...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">But everyone should go outside,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that's what I'm saying.</font>

465
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:50,163
<font color="#00ffff">The way we picked wasn't</font>
<font color="#00ffff">probably the most democratic.</font>

466
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:52,683
<font color="#00ffff">Why should Kyra and Harry,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the people who've already got</font>

467
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:55,003
<font color="#00ffff">a Shield, be having</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the opportunity to get a Shield?</font>

468
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:57,203
<font color="#00ffff">I think not being a team player</font>
<font color="#00ffff">is just as bad</font>

469
00:21:57,243 --> 00:22:00,683
<font color="#00ffff">as being a Traitor at the moment.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I don't like the selfishness at all.</font>

470
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:05,003
<font color="#ffff00">It's about getting...getting that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">cash for all of us.</font> <font color="#00ff00">I don't care.</font>

471
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:05,163
<font color="#ffff00">It's about getting...getting that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">cash for all of us.</font> <font color="#00ff00">I don't care.</font>

472
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:07,443
Guys, you've got to pick,
let's do this.

473
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:09,923
<font color="#ffff00">We need one more</font>
<font color="#ffff00">person on this side.</font>

474
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:11,923
<font color="#00ffff">How the hell are</font>
<font color="#00ffff">we meant to find Traitors</font>

475
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,643
<font color="#00ffff">if we can't even agree who</font>
<font color="#00ffff">goes inside and who goes outside?</font>

476
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:16,763
<font color="#00ffff">I mean, come on.</font>

477
00:22:18,843 --> 00:22:20,923
OK, so that's the nine.

478
00:22:20,963 --> 00:22:22,483
Is everyone happy?

479
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:23,643
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

480
00:22:23,683 --> 00:22:25,763
Zack, you're not happy.<font color="#00ff00">No.</font>

481
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,483
Who... Would you like to swap
with someone?<font color="#00ff00">No, I'm all right.</font>

482
00:22:28,523 --> 00:22:30,323
<font color="#ffff00">Voice your opinion.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">No, I'm good, I'm good.</font>

483
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:32,363
<font color="#ffff00">Zack felt that me and Harry</font>
<font color="#ffff00">should have stayed inside</font>

484
00:22:32,403 --> 00:22:34,003
<font color="#ffff00">and given someone else</font>
<font color="#ffff00">an opportunity.</font>

485
00:22:34,043 --> 00:22:36,283
<font color="#ffff00">It's giving very much Traitor vibes</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that he's pissed off</font>

486
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:38,403
<font color="#ffff00">because I keep getting the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">opportunity to have a Shield</font>

487
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:40,403
<font color="#ffff00">and it's, like, back the hell up.</font>

488
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,603
<font color="#00ffff">Forget about the Shields,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">let's build the money.</font> <font color="#ffff00">Shall we</font>
<font color="#ffff00">just build the pot, yeah?</font>

489
00:22:43,643 --> 00:22:46,323
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, we got it, guys. It doesn't</font>
<font color="#ffff00">matter, come on.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Forget about it.</font>

490
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:49,203
Well said, Charlotte.<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>
OK. Let me tell you about the task.

491
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:52,083
The beautiful castle grounds

492
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:55,643
have many exotic birds.

493
00:22:55,683 --> 00:23:00,243
You will hear a variety of their
calls all across the grounds.

494
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:00,483
You will hear a variety of their
calls all across the grounds.

495
00:23:00,523 --> 00:23:04,003
You nine must now
get into teams of three.

496
00:23:04,043 --> 00:23:07,363
Your job will be to find the birds.

497
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:11,923
You will then have to mimic
the birds' call to those

498
00:23:11,963 --> 00:23:13,723
who are in the castle.

499
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:18,323
In the castle, your job is to find
the correct replica

500
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:18,403
In the castle, your job is to find
the correct replica

501
00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:19,763
and bring it to me.

502
00:23:19,803 --> 00:23:21,163
BIRD CALLS

503
00:23:21,203 --> 00:23:22,843
They have names.

504
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:25,483
Let me introduce you to Beaky.

505
00:23:25,523 --> 00:23:28,323
BIRD:<font color="#ffff00">Cock-a-doodle-doo.</font>
LAUGHTER

506
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:32,523
You've got only one chance
each bird call.

507
00:23:32,563 --> 00:23:34,403
OK, so our three teams,

508
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:38,763
you will each be given a map
of the nesting grounds

509
00:23:38,803 --> 00:23:40,243
of the birds.

510
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:47,283
On those maps there is also
the nesting ground of the very

511
00:23:47,323 --> 00:23:49,963
rare Shield bird.

512
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:53,123
If you decide to take time
out of the mission

513
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:56,723
and can get the castle group to
correctly identify it,

514
00:23:56,763 --> 00:24:01,203
you will automatically win
three Shields.

515
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:03,683
You have 25 minutes to do it,

516
00:24:03,723 --> 00:24:04,963
but I have faith.

517
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:10,483
Bird watchers, please go
and get in your starting positions.

518
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:12,563
The rest of you, you come with me.
Come on.

519
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:20,203
<font color="#00ffff">Good luck, guys!</font> <font color="#00ff00">Good luck!</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Good luck, guys!</font>

520
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:22,843
<font color="#00ffff">I think the missions are key</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to find out</font>

521
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:25,163
<font color="#00ffff">people's true self.</font>

522
00:24:25,203 --> 00:24:27,643
<font color="#00ffff">In stressful environments,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that's when people show</font>

523
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:29,043
<font color="#00ffff">their true colours.</font>

524
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:35,763
Everyone ready?
ALL:<font color="#ffff00">Yes!</font>

525

527
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:41,123
<font color="#00ffff">Jas to Claudia,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">we're ready to rumble.</font>

528
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:42,323
ON RADIO: Enormous luck.

529
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:45,043
For £6,000,

614
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,963
<font color="#00ff00">I would go and get the money first</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and if there's time at the end,</font>

615
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:11,603

You heard seven bird calls.

You correctly identified
five of them.

723

There was a cheeky
Shield bird in there,

There was a cheeky
Shield bird in there,

725

but you made £4,000
for the prize pot.

whether they make themselves known.

736
00:32:48,523 --> 00:32:51,843
Would anybody like to say,
"Yeah, I got a Shield"?

737
00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:57,563
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, I think we should,</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Shields and were protected.</font>

742
00:33:07,883 --> 00:33:11,043
<font color="#ffff00">It's glaringly obvious that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Anthony's a Traitor</font>

743
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,363
<font color="#ffff00">and not a team player.</font>

744
00:33:12,403 --> 00:33:17,523
Andrew, Paul, Anthony,
you will sleep soundly tonight.

745
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:20,723
You are protected against murder.

746
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:25,003
However, you are not protected,
any of you, against banishment

747
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:26,523
However, you are not protected,
any of you, against banishment

748
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:29,123
and on that note,
I'll see you very soon

749
00:33:29,163 --> 00:33:33,083
for the very first banishment
at the Round Table.

750
00:33:33,123 --> 00:33:34,443
<font color="#ffff00">Oh! Oh, God!</font>

751
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:36,083
I hope you like tension.

752
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:44,923
<font color="#ffff00">I bet you're happy you can</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sleep easy tonight.</font>

753
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:46,603
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, I know.</font>

754
00:33:46,643 --> 00:33:48,403
<font color="#00ffff">It's funny that it got like a boo.</font>

755
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,803
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, no, it was just like a,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">"Ooh, lucky you."</font>

756
00:33:50,843 --> 00:33:53,043
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I think there was a boo.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">It wasn't my call to go and do it.</font>

757
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:58,043
<font color="#00ff00">Ooh, I love this fire.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I love it, I love it, I love it.</font>

758
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,083
<font color="#ffff00">So, what was it like out there,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Paul?</font>

759
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,203
<font color="#00ffff">So it was good.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">We all had two places to go to</font>

760
00:34:02,243 --> 00:34:03,843
<font color="#00ffff">and then there was the Shields.</font>

761
00:34:03,883 --> 00:34:06,123
<font color="#00ff00">Whose call was it to get</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the Shields first?</font>

762
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:07,483
<font color="#00ffff">Andrew.</font>

763
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:10,523
<font color="#00ff00">Nothing wrong with it.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, I don't think there's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">anything wrong with it...</font>

764
00:34:10,563 --> 00:34:13,963
<font color="#00ff00">There's nothing wrong with it.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">..actually, weirdly, but it feels...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know what I think?</font>

765
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:15,923
<font color="#ffff00">In my group,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we didn't go for the Shield first.</font>

766
00:34:15,963 --> 00:34:18,203
<font color="#ffff00">We said it would be unfair to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">go for the Shield first</font>

767
00:34:18,243 --> 00:34:21,923
<font color="#ffff00">because you guys in the castle...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Didn't get that chance.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">..didn't get that chance.</font>

768
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:23,363
<font color="#ffff00">To be honest, I knew they were</font>

769
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:25,683
<font color="#ffff00">going to for it first. They've got</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Andrew on that team and I think</font>

770
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:29,083
<font color="#ffff00">he's a Traitor. Don't get me wrong,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I really love Paul. I think had</font>

771
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:30,643
<font color="#ffff00">he been placed in a different team,</font>

772
00:34:30,683 --> 00:34:33,923
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think he would have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">gone to the Shield first.</font>

773
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:36,523
<font color="#ffff00">Rightly or wrongly,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">whether you like it or not,</font>

774
00:34:36,563 --> 00:34:39,283
<font color="#ffff00">whether you get a Shield,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you are going to carry</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the weight of having the Shield</font>

775
00:34:39,323 --> 00:34:42,043
<font color="#ffff00">and you're going to carry the weight</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of having the opinions of it.</font>

776
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,163
<font color="#00ff00">But you're also going to have</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a very good night's sleep.</font>

777
00:34:44,203 --> 00:34:47,523
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, exactly. Exactly, so...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Exactly.</font>
LAUGHTER

778
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:52,003
<font color="#00ffff">We're all going to have to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">accuse someone.</font>

779
00:34:52,043 --> 00:34:56,363
<font color="#00ffff">I can just imagine a lot of people</font>
<font color="#00ffff">taking it very personally.</font> <font color="#00ff00">Mm.</font>

780
00:34:56,403 --> 00:34:56,563
<font color="#00ffff">I can just imagine a lot of people</font>
<font color="#00ffff">taking it very personally.</font> <font color="#00ff00">Mm.</font>

781
00:34:56,603 --> 00:34:59,523
<font color="#00ffff">The first banishment is</font>
<font color="#00ffff">going to be awful.</font>

782
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:02,763
<font color="#00ffff">Anything can happen, so it's prepare</font>

783
00:35:02,803 --> 00:35:04,563
<font color="#00ffff">for the worst, hope for the best.</font>

784
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,283
<font color="#00ff00">You've got so little to go on.</font>

785
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:09,443
<font color="#00ff00">You have to just find the smallest</font>
<font color="#00ff00">thing to go off.</font> <font color="#ffff00">Yeah, I know.</font>

786
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,483
<font color="#00ffff">You're not a Traitor, are you?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">You could be a Traitor,</font>

787
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:13,843
<font color="#00ffff">you know, that's the thing.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not a Traitor.</font>

788
00:35:13,883 --> 00:35:14,923
<font color="#ffff00">I'm a Faithful.</font>

789
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:17,923
<font color="#00ffff">That's the whole thing,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">isn't it? Like...</font> <font color="#00ff00">Are you?</font>

790
00:35:17,963 --> 00:35:19,883
<font color="#00ffff">Well, course. The thing is...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Of course you are!</font>

791
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,283
<font color="#00ffff">I thought being a Traitor would be</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the easier role to play, actually,</font>

792
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:28,083
<font color="#00ffff">cos I thought, you know, you get to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">see everything, you're in the know,</font>

793
00:35:28,123 --> 00:35:31,123
<font color="#00ffff">you get to be in control, this,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">that and the other, but actually,</font>

794
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:33,403
<font color="#00ffff">people continue watching</font>

795
00:35:33,443 --> 00:35:35,723
<font color="#00ffff">and it's a little bit uncomfortable.</font>

796
00:35:36,963 --> 00:35:41,163
<font color="#00ff00">I have a very strong</font>
<font color="#00ff00">feeling about who I think it is.</font>

797
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:46,443
<font color="#00ff00">The one that has really been</font>
<font color="#00ff00">rude to me as well.</font>

798
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:48,843
<font color="#ffff00">I know who you're on about</font>
<font color="#ffff00">because everyone's got their back up</font>

799
00:35:48,883 --> 00:35:50,283
<font color="#ffff00">and there's been a massive change.</font>

800
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:52,843
<font color="#00ffff">The only thing I would say is that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">he just keeps himself to himself.</font>

801
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:56,163
<font color="#00ff00">But it weren't like that at the</font>
<font color="#00ff00">beginning, though, was it?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">He wasn't like that.</font>

802
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:58,283
<font color="#00ffff">The thing with me, right,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I'll give you, I'll give you one</font>

803
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,923
<font color="#00ffff">that I think, I personally think is</font>
<font color="#00ffff">who I'm going to call out tonight.</font>

804
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:03,963
WHISPERING:<font color="#00ff00">Who?</font>

805
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:07,883
<font color="#00ffff">She's...</font> <font color="#00ff00">Mm.</font> <font color="#00ffff">..stirring.</font>

806
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:16,203
<font color="#00ff00">I was the first person he met,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">so I know.</font>

807
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:17,603
<font color="#00ff00">With Anthony,</font>

808
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:19,523
<font color="#00ff00">because he's so aloof</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and he's so abrupt,</font>

809
00:36:19,563 --> 00:36:22,443
<font color="#00ff00">and he's completely</font>
<font color="#00ff00">different to day one.</font>

810
00:36:23,963 --> 00:36:27,283
<font color="#00ff00">If someone's consistently acting</font>
<font color="#00ff00">odd, you've got to question it.</font>

811
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:29,843
<font color="#00ffff">So, who do you think you're going</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to vote for then?</font>

812
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:31,083
<font color="#00ff00">Sonja.</font>

813
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:35,923
<font color="#00ffff">I think you need to be very</font>
<font color="#00ffff">careful about voting for people that</font>

814
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:37,163
<font color="#00ffff">other people are OK with.</font>

815
00:36:37,203 --> 00:36:39,203
<font color="#00ffff">Cos then you're...you'll</font>
<font color="#00ffff">be challenged.</font>

816
00:36:40,723 --> 00:36:41,923
<font color="#00ff00">Really?</font> <font color="#00ffff">Mm.</font>

817
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:54,003
# Mm-mm-mmm

818
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:55,923
# Mm-mmm

819
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,563
# Mm-mm-mmm

820
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:01,203
# Hm-hm-hm-hmm. #

821
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:04,323
It's time for our very first
banishment

822
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:08,283
and the players will get their first
taste of castle politics.

823
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:10,203
They're going to vote somebody out.

824
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:14,483
Will they catch a guilty Traitor,
or banish an innocent Faithful?

825
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:14,643
Will they catch a guilty Traitor,
or banish an innocent Faithful?

826
00:37:14,683 --> 00:37:17,283
I'm going to be honest,
this is my favourite bit.

827
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:19,443
It's time for the Round Table.

828
00:37:22,963 --> 00:37:24,083
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">Tonight's the night.</font>

829
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:26,363
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">It's the first time that we've gone</font>
<font color="#ffff00">through a banishment.</font>

830
00:37:26,403 --> 00:37:28,243
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">I'm nervous about it.</font>

831
00:37:28,283 --> 00:37:30,643
{\an8}<font color="#00ffff">It's about to get</font>
<font color="#00ffff">hot in the kitchen.</font>

832
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:35,243
{\an8}<font color="#00ff00">The atmosphere is pin-drop tense.</font>

833
00:37:51,243 --> 00:37:53,443
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">We're all Traitor</font>
<font color="#ffff00">hunting at this Round Table,</font>

834
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:55,843
{\an8}<font color="#ffff00">like, I want to catch a Traitor</font>
<font color="#ffff00">more than anything.</font>

835
00:37:55,883 --> 00:37:59,843
{\an8}<font color="#00ffff">The pressure of 20 other people all</font>
<font color="#00ffff">watching for your facial</font>

836
00:37:59,883 --> 00:38:02,123
{\an8}<font color="#00ffff">expressions, your fidgetiness,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">everything.</font>

837
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:03,563
{\an8}<font color="#00ffff">The pressure's unimaginable.</font>

838
00:38:08,563 --> 00:38:10,803
Welcome to the Round Table.

839
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,163
This is where it really begins.

840
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:22,483
Congratulations, your prize pot
currently stands at £19,000.

841
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:23,323
Congratulations, your prize pot
currently stands at £19,000.

842
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:28,403
But who's going to take
the money at the end?

843
00:38:31,883 --> 00:38:36,283
The last time we were in here,
I chose the Traitors.

844
00:38:36,323 --> 00:38:36,363
The last time we were in here,
I chose the Traitors.

845
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:44,163
So, Faithful, I'm wondering
if you can do the same.

846
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:51,603
You will all get one vote each.

847
00:38:54,483 --> 00:38:57,643
And whoever gets the most votes will
be banished

848
00:38:57,683 --> 00:39:00,323
from the castle forever.

849
00:39:04,163 --> 00:39:06,003
So...

850
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,883
..who can you trust?

851
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:12,363
Who's already lying?

852
00:39:15,243 --> 00:39:17,603
Maybe who's changed?

853
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:23,563
It feels like a conversation
needs to take place.

854
00:39:26,203 --> 00:39:27,603
Who would like to begin?

855
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:29,683
<font color="#ffff00">I would like to begin.</font>

856
00:39:29,723 --> 00:39:31,603
<font color="#00ffff">Ooh!</font> <font color="#00ff00">Go on, Diane.</font>

857
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:33,443
<font color="#00ffff">Go on!</font> <font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

858
00:39:33,483 --> 00:39:36,563
<font color="#ffff00">So this started for me</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the very first day we arrived.</font>

859
00:39:36,603 --> 00:39:37,963
<font color="#ffff00">We had to stand in line.</font>

860
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:42,003
<font color="#ffff00">Because of last year, I wanted to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">be in the middle and I went and</font>

861
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:45,563
<font color="#ffff00">stood beside Anthony to get into the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">line and he looked down at me and he</font>

862
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:47,323
<font color="#ffff00">said, well, he just wouldn't move</font>

863
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:49,163
<font color="#ffff00">and I said, "Could I get in,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">please?"</font>

864
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:52,283
<font color="#ffff00">And he still continued to look at me</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and wouldn't move.</font>

865
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:56,283
<font color="#ffff00">Now, that to me smacks of somebody</font>
<font color="#ffff00">who's out for themselves.</font>

866
00:39:57,683 --> 00:39:59,643
<font color="#ffff00">Absolutely not having that.</font>

867
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:04,443
<font color="#00ffff">Quite simply, at the start when,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">erm, we were in line,</font>

868
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:07,603
<font color="#00ffff">and myself and John were trying</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to get in order,</font>

869
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:10,163
<font color="#00ffff">you have not spoken to me,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you have not hugged me.</font>

870
00:40:10,203 --> 00:40:13,043
<font color="#00ffff">I've spoken to practically every</font>
<font color="#00ffff">person in this room.</font>

871
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,763
<font color="#00ffff">If I've got a problem with anybody,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I will come straight to them</font>

872
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:17,683
<font color="#00ffff">and deal with them.</font>

873
00:40:17,723 --> 00:40:20,723
<font color="#00ffff">Why is it, it's only now that you</font>
<font color="#00ffff">decide to do that?</font>

874
00:40:22,163 --> 00:40:24,323
<font color="#00ff00">In fairness, I do find you to be</font>
<font color="#00ff00">very defensive</font>

875
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:25,883
<font color="#00ff00">and you know me and you get on.</font>

876
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,003
<font color="#00ff00">And I have seen a few</font>
<font color="#00ff00">times that there seems to be</font>

877
00:40:29,043 --> 00:40:31,403
<font color="#00ff00">a change in demeanour since the day</font>
<font color="#00ff00">we met on the platform,</font>

878
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:33,523
<font color="#00ff00">like, you were so happy</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and so bubbly.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Really?</font>

879
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:35,363
<font color="#00ff00">But it does ring in my head,</font>

880
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:38,163
<font color="#00ff00">is someone cracking under a little</font>
<font color="#00ff00">bit of pressure there?</font>

881
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:43,283
<font color="#00ffff">If somebody accuses me</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of something that I know is not so,</font>

882
00:40:43,323 --> 00:40:46,003
<font color="#00ffff">why should I go, "OK, then".</font>
<font color="#00ffff">You know, no. Just I will...</font>

883
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,563
ALL TALK AT ONCE
<font color="#00ffff">..do you understand?</font> <font color="#00ff00">I don't think</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Anthony's a Traitor.</font>

884
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:50,483
<font color="#00ff00">I know it's not worth much in this</font>
<font color="#00ff00">conversation.</font>

885
00:40:50,523 --> 00:40:53,123
<font color="#00ff00">I think he's defensive, but I don't</font>
<font color="#00ff00">think it makes you a Traitor.</font>

886
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:56,843
<font color="#ffff00">I'll be completely honest</font>

887
00:40:56,883 --> 00:40:58,923
<font color="#ffff00">and open the floor of what</font>
<font color="#ffff00">suspicions I've heard.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Go on.</font>

888
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:02,843
<font color="#ffff00">I've heard about you, Andrew.</font>

889
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:04,483
<font color="#ffff00">At the beginning</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of the challenge today,</font>

890
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:06,643
<font color="#ffff00">you were saying that how, erm,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's not about the Shield,</font>

891
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:08,683
<font color="#ffff00">it's not about the Shield,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's not about the Shield.</font>

892
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:10,363
<font color="#ffff00">However,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">when the mission first started,</font>

893
00:41:10,403 --> 00:41:12,723
<font color="#ffff00">you directed the group to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">go for the Shield straight away.</font>

894
00:41:13,923 --> 00:41:15,963
<font color="#00ffff">I just said, and the whole group</font>
<font color="#00ffff">didn't agree on that.</font>

895
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:18,563
<font color="#ffff00">That's what I heard because...</font> <font color="#00ff00">Shall</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I pick...</font> <font color="#ffff00">Now you can pick up.</font>

896
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:19,723
<font color="#00ff00">Er, so that...that was me.</font>

897
00:41:19,763 --> 00:41:24,203
<font color="#00ff00">So, if we're trying to pick a name,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the name I thought was you,</font>

898
00:41:24,243 --> 00:41:25,483
<font color="#00ff00">So, if we're trying to pick a name,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the name I thought was you,</font>

899
00:41:25,523 --> 00:41:28,483
<font color="#00ff00">and...</font> <font color="#00ffff">Right.</font> <font color="#00ff00">..to be honest,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">it was that comment.</font>

900
00:41:28,523 --> 00:41:31,083
<font color="#00ff00">"Forget the Shields,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">forget the Shields."</font>

901
00:41:31,123 --> 00:41:33,643
<font color="#00ff00">And then we got together and it was,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">"Let's go get the Shields."</font>

902
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:35,323
<font color="#00ff00">But then I'm with you as well,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and I agreed.</font>

903
00:41:35,363 --> 00:41:37,123
<font color="#00ffff">Yesterday, people went for Shields</font>

904
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:41,083
<font color="#00ffff">and put no effort or contribution at</font>
<font color="#00ffff">all, and I got a problem with that.</font>

905
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,443
<font color="#00ffff">We got everything we did today,</font>

906
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:44,123
<font color="#00ffff">so we couldn't do any more today</font>
<font color="#00ffff">than what we did.</font>

907
00:41:44,163 --> 00:41:45,963
<font color="#00ffff">We done everything</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and the Shield was a bonus on top.</font>

908
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,203
<font color="#00ffff">The Shield was quite close to us.</font>

909
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:50,723
<font color="#ffff00">My thing is that I felt like the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">challenge was more important.</font>

910
00:41:50,763 --> 00:41:52,403
<font color="#ffff00">I don't...of course I would want</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the Shield.</font>

911
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,843
<font color="#ffff00">It would be unfair for me</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to go for the Shield first, because</font>

912
00:41:54,883 --> 00:41:57,243
<font color="#ffff00">I haven't completed the challenge</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and the people at the castle...</font>

913
00:41:57,283 --> 00:41:58,323
<font color="#00ffff">Then why be hypocritical?</font>

914
00:41:58,363 --> 00:42:00,843
<font color="#ffff00">It's not hypocritical, because I...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">You did the same thing yesterday.</font>

915
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:02,763
<font color="#ffff00">It's not hypocritical. We all had to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">run past the Shield.</font>

916
00:42:02,803 --> 00:42:06,603
<font color="#ffff00">Yesterday everyone had the equal</font>
<font color="#ffff00">opportunity to get a Shield.</font>

917
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:09,163
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't have a equal opportunity,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">because I can't swim.</font>

918
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:11,003
<font color="#00ffff">But the issue is...</font>
<font color="#00ff00">No, she's talking.</font>

919
00:42:11,043 --> 00:42:12,483
<font color="#00ff00">Just for a minute, please.</font>

920
00:42:12,523 --> 00:42:15,603
<font color="#ffff00">So therefore, the two Shields in the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sea were not up for grabs for me.</font>

921
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:17,563
<font color="#00ffff">The reason why I say it's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">hypocritical is you can't say</font>

922
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:19,083
<font color="#00ffff">you were doing it for the team</font>
<font color="#00ffff">instead,</font>

923
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:20,803
<font color="#00ffff">when people were still</font>
<font color="#00ffff">bound when you went for it.</font>

924
00:42:20,843 --> 00:42:22,923
<font color="#00ffff">I was untying Miles</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and I saw you run for it.</font>

925
00:42:22,963 --> 00:42:25,963
<font color="#00ffff">So, to suggest that he did it for...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">No, I actually, I asked someone,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">"Does anybody need help?"</font>

926
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:27,643
<font color="#ffff00">OK, that's fine.</font> <font color="#00ffff">I let you talk, let</font>
<font color="#00ffff">me talk.</font>

927
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:29,403
<font color="#00ffff">..suggest that you did it for the</font>
<font color="#00ffff">team</font>

928
00:42:29,443 --> 00:42:31,243
<font color="#00ffff">but he didn't is just hypocritical.</font>

929
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:33,483
<font color="#00ff00">Guys, I just want to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">know who the Traitor is.</font>

930
00:42:33,523 --> 00:42:36,443
<font color="#00ff00">Please, I just want to say my</font>
<font color="#00ff00">speech, cos we're on that topic,</font>

931
00:42:36,483 --> 00:42:39,483
<font color="#00ff00">yeah, so obviously I've got nothing</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to go off and, like, honestly,</font>

932
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:43,243
<font color="#00ff00">the only thing I've got to go off is</font>
<font color="#00ff00">you, Zack, as a Traitor, because</font>

933
00:42:43,283 --> 00:42:46,403
<font color="#00ff00">for me, it's like, you're so, like,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">you're always a laughy guy and stuff</font>

934
00:42:46,443 --> 00:42:49,323
<font color="#00ff00">like that, and the only thing I've</font>
<font color="#00ff00">got to go off is the round table</font>

935
00:42:49,363 --> 00:42:52,083
<font color="#00ff00">of when the Traitors were chosen,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">you were laughing at anything, any</font>

936
00:42:52,123 --> 00:42:54,683
<font color="#00ff00">sound, like you was all making, like</font>
<font color="#00ff00">laughs, do you know what I mean?</font>

937
00:42:54,723 --> 00:42:56,203
<font color="#00ffff">Everything since then...</font>

938
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:58,483
<font color="#00ff00">No, but, when you took the blindfold</font>
<font color="#00ff00">off, it was like a different,</font>

939
00:42:58,523 --> 00:43:00,963
<font color="#00ff00">as if, like, it was like something</font>
<font color="#00ff00">had happened.</font>

940
00:43:02,003 --> 00:43:03,723
<font color="#00ff00">So I just wanted to put</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that out there.</font>

941
00:43:03,763 --> 00:43:05,203
<font color="#00ff00">That's all I've had to go off.</font>

942
00:43:05,243 --> 00:43:09,443
<font color="#ffff00">I've got a suspicion and it's only</font>
<font color="#ffff00">based on what I have witnessed</font>

943
00:43:09,483 --> 00:43:13,123
<font color="#ffff00">and what's happened to me,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and, er, Sonja, that's yourself.</font>

944
00:43:13,163 --> 00:43:14,203
<font color="#00ffff">Yep.</font>

945
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:18,203
<font color="#ffff00">Yesterday in the task, Zack,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you made a comment saying,</font>

946
00:43:18,243 --> 00:43:20,963
<font color="#ffff00">"I'll sleep well tonight," and then</font>
<font color="#ffff00">me and Evie joked and we said,</font>

947
00:43:21,003 --> 00:43:23,083
<font color="#ffff00">"Oh, will you now?" You know?</font>

948
00:43:23,123 --> 00:43:25,403
<font color="#ffff00">Potentially that's Traitor speak.</font>

949
00:43:27,323 --> 00:43:29,403
<font color="#ffff00">Obviously, we know what you're like.</font>

950
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:31,123
<font color="#ffff00">You chat, you joke.</font>

951
00:43:31,163 --> 00:43:34,003
<font color="#ffff00">We said, but that's just Zack,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you know, he runs his mouth,</font>

952
00:43:34,043 --> 00:43:35,403
<font color="#ffff00">he's like a little Jack Russell.</font>

953
00:43:35,443 --> 00:43:38,683
<font color="#ffff00">And then went into sun room and</font>
<font color="#ffff00">there was a group of you, including</font>

954
00:43:38,723 --> 00:43:42,403
<font color="#ffff00">yourself, Sonja, and you went, "Just</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the man we want to see," to me.</font>

955
00:43:42,443 --> 00:43:45,603
<font color="#ffff00">And then Sonja, you went, "Just</font>
<font color="#ffff00">tell them all what you said that</font>

956
00:43:45,643 --> 00:43:47,483
<font color="#ffff00">"Zack said," so...</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">..in my opinion,</font>

957
00:43:47,523 --> 00:43:49,203
<font color="#ffff00">you were giving it a little stir.</font>

958
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:52,603
<font color="#00ff00">I'm taking this as evidence</font>

959
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:55,483
<font color="#00ff00">and information that I'm obviously</font>
<font color="#00ff00">gathering pretty much now.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

960
00:43:55,523 --> 00:43:58,883
<font color="#00ff00">Obviously when you hear about it...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font> <font color="#00ff00">..it looks like deflection.</font>

961
00:43:58,923 --> 00:44:01,283
<font color="#ffff00">I think it's really about</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the stirring.</font>

962
00:44:01,323 --> 00:44:03,803
<font color="#ffff00">Erm, I've seen you directly do this.</font>

963
00:44:05,123 --> 00:44:07,003
<font color="#ffff00">You're starting a conversation</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and immediately,</font>

964
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:09,363
<font color="#ffff00">before you say anything,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">"Oh, well, you're a Traitor, so..."</font>

965
00:44:10,963 --> 00:44:12,643
<font color="#ffff00">I feel uneasy about you, basically.</font>

966
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,283
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, I can see why</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you're saying it.</font>

967
00:44:15,603 --> 00:44:19,963
<font color="#00ffff">If I was a Traitor, which I'm not,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">then I think I'd be making</font>

968
00:44:20,003 --> 00:44:24,123
<font color="#00ffff">an effort to actually build</font>
<font color="#00ffff">alliances and friends.</font>

969
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:27,843
<font color="#00ffff">I can look you all in the eye</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and say I am a Faithful,</font>

970
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:29,603
<font color="#00ffff">whatever you think.</font>

971
00:44:29,643 --> 00:44:30,963
<font color="#00ffff">You're wasting your vote.</font>

972
00:44:31,003 --> 00:44:32,123
<font color="#00ffff">Don't do it, guys.</font>

973
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:37,923
<font color="#00ff00">I'm going to say here, I don't</font>
<font color="#00ff00">think you're a Traitor, by the way.</font>

974
00:44:37,963 --> 00:44:41,043
<font color="#ffff00">I think like everybody else, like,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we're just clutching at straws here.</font>

975
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:44,403
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font> <font color="#00ff00">There's a lot of direction</font>
<font color="#00ff00">going towards you, Sonja...</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

976
00:44:44,443 --> 00:44:48,323
<font color="#00ff00">..and if I choose you tonight...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font> <font color="#00ff00">..and it's not you,</font>

977
00:44:48,363 --> 00:44:51,683
<font color="#00ff00">I'm sorry, Ross, but I'll be looking</font>
<font color="#00ff00">at you after this.</font>

978
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:53,643
<font color="#ffff00">Ooh, strong words.</font>

979
00:44:53,683 --> 00:44:55,763
<font color="#00ffff">Three other people have also made</font>
<font color="#00ffff">a point about Sonja,</font>

980
00:44:55,803 --> 00:44:58,363
<font color="#00ffff">so why...why would you target me?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, because I just feel like</font>

981
00:44:58,403 --> 00:45:00,723
<font color="#00ff00">the direction's coming from you</font>

982
00:45:00,763 --> 00:45:03,523
<font color="#00ff00">and I'm just sitting and</font>
<font color="#00ff00">observing, right?</font>

983
00:45:03,563 --> 00:45:05,643
<font color="#00ff00">I'm not saying you're definitely</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a Traitor,</font>

984
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:07,403
<font color="#00ff00">I'm saying I'm going</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to be looking at you.</font>

985
00:45:08,763 --> 00:45:12,163
Players, the time for talk is over.

986
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:17,483
I'm going to need you to
write down one name,

987
00:45:17,523 --> 00:45:22,043
and that name is the person that you
believe is a Traitor.

988
00:45:37,043 --> 00:45:39,763
Has everyone locked in their
answers?<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

989
00:45:43,403 --> 00:45:46,203
Jaz, we're going to start with you.

990
00:45:48,443 --> 00:45:52,363
Please tell me the name of the
person you believe is a Traitor

991
00:45:52,403 --> 00:45:53,483
and why.

992
00:45:56,603 --> 00:45:59,883
<font color="#ffff00">Just going to go with, er, Sonja,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">just after hearing,</font>

993
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:04,603
<font color="#ffff00">listening to sort of the group.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, Sonja.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Fair enough.</font> <font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

994
00:46:04,643 --> 00:46:08,083
Diane, who do you believe is
a Traitor and why?

995
00:46:08,123 --> 00:46:11,363
<font color="#00ff00">I'm going for Anthony, cos I don't</font>
<font color="#00ff00">believe you're a team player.</font>

996
00:46:15,883 --> 00:46:16,883
Harry?

997
00:46:17,923 --> 00:46:19,203
<font color="#ffff00">So I've gone with Zack.</font>

998
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:20,923
<font color="#ffff00">Obviously, I told you.</font>

999
00:46:20,963 --> 00:46:23,323
<font color="#ffff00">Like, I know...I know it might just</font>
<font color="#ffff00">be you and I hope I'm wrong,</font>

1000
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,563
<font color="#ffff00">honestly, but I feel like it could</font>
<font color="#ffff00">be the added pressure of</font>

1001
00:46:25,603 --> 00:46:27,843
<font color="#ffff00">being a Traitor.</font> <font color="#00ffff">You're wrong.</font>

1002
00:46:29,763 --> 00:46:32,763
Zack, what name is on your board
and why?

1003
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:34,163
<font color="#00ff00">I've gone with you, Sonja.</font>

1004
00:46:34,203 --> 00:46:37,203
<font color="#00ff00">Erm, I feel like it was the only</font>
<font color="#00ff00">evidence we had.</font>

1005
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:40,803
<font color="#00ff00">I apologise for it...</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font> <font color="#00ff00">..I</font>
<font color="#00ff00">really...I really do like you.</font>

1006
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,883
Jonny, who have you voted for?

1007
00:46:44,923 --> 00:46:48,243
<font color="#ffff00">Sonja, you beautiful lady,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry.</font>

1008
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:52,483
<font color="#ffff00">Based on potential evidence...</font> <font color="#00ffff">Mm.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">..I've voted for you.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

1009
00:46:55,643 --> 00:46:58,083
Mollie, who have you voted for?

1010
00:46:58,123 --> 00:47:00,003
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, I'm really sorry, Sonja...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

1011
00:47:00,043 --> 00:47:02,563
<font color="#00ff00">..I think you're a fabulous woman,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">but I voted for you.</font>

1012
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:03,643
<font color="#00ffff">Thank you.</font>

1013
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:10,363
Miles.<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, just gone with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">yourself, Sonja.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah, fine.</font>

1014
00:47:10,403 --> 00:47:14,843
<font color="#ffff00">Just because it kind of comes across</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with sloppy game-playing, maybe.</font>

1015
00:47:14,883 --> 00:47:14,963
<font color="#ffff00">Just because it kind of comes across</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with sloppy game-playing, maybe.</font>

1016
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:19,763
Tracey.<font color="#00ff00">Erm, I have gone for you,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Anthony.</font>

1017
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:22,363
<font color="#00ff00">I'm sorry, it's not personal,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">but your behaviour</font>

1018
00:47:22,403 --> 00:47:26,203
<font color="#00ff00">from the train compared to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">afterwards was very different.</font>

1019
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:32,683
Sonja,
who do you believe is a Traitor?

1020
00:47:32,723 --> 00:47:36,123
<font color="#ffff00">Well, Ross, this is such</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a coincidence, because, erm,</font>

1021
00:47:36,163 --> 00:47:41,363
<font color="#ffff00">I have voted for you and the reason</font>
<font color="#ffff00">why is nothing to do with tonight.</font>

1022
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:41,483
<font color="#ffff00">I have voted for you and the reason</font>
<font color="#ffff00">why is nothing to do with tonight.</font>

1023
00:47:41,523 --> 00:47:44,763
<font color="#ffff00">It was actually</font>
<font color="#ffff00">when we were round this table</font>

1024
00:47:44,803 --> 00:47:47,723
<font color="#ffff00">and we all took our blindfolds off,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I thought</font>

1025
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:51,363
<font color="#ffff00">you reacted rather strangely to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">something Claudia said.</font>

1026
00:47:53,643 --> 00:47:55,363
So, a vote round-up.

1027
00:47:55,403 --> 00:47:57,843
Five votes for Sonja,
two for Anthony,

1028
00:47:57,883 --> 00:48:00,483
one for Zack and one for Ross.

1029
00:48:02,483 --> 00:48:05,363
Andrew, your name please, and why.

1030
00:48:05,403 --> 00:48:08,563
<font color="#00ff00">Before I came in here, I'm a strong</font>
<font color="#00ff00">guy mentally and physically,</font>

1031
00:48:08,603 --> 00:48:10,083
<font color="#00ff00">and I said I would only</font>
<font color="#00ff00">go on evidence,</font>

1032
00:48:10,123 --> 00:48:13,283
<font color="#00ff00">but based on the evidence we've had</font>
<font color="#00ff00">tonight, I have to vote for Sonja.</font>

1033
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:17,283
Jasmine,
who do you believe is a Traitor?

1034
00:48:17,323 --> 00:48:18,643
<font color="#ffff00">It's nothing personal.</font>

1035
00:48:18,683 --> 00:48:20,723
<font color="#ffff00">It's just based off what everyone</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was saying today.</font>

1036
00:48:20,763 --> 00:48:22,243
<font color="#ffff00">So I'm voting for you, Sonja.</font>

1037
00:48:26,963 --> 00:48:28,163
Ross.

1038
00:48:28,203 --> 00:48:32,283
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, Sonja, I'm really sorry,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">I've gone off facts.</font>

1039
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:35,283
<font color="#00ff00">If you end up going out, I'll miss</font>
<font color="#00ff00">you, I'll miss your outfits.</font>

1040
00:48:36,523 --> 00:48:38,723
Ash, who have you voted for?

1041
00:48:38,763 --> 00:48:40,443
<font color="#ffff00">Er, I do have to give you my vote,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Sonja.</font>

1042
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:41,843
<font color="#00ffff">That's absolutely fine, Ash.</font>

1043
00:48:41,883 --> 00:48:46,203
<font color="#ffff00">Erm, but I just have to say,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's been a lotta, lotta laughs.</font>

1044
00:48:46,243 --> 00:48:46,403
<font color="#ffff00">Erm, but I just have to say,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's been a lotta, lotta laughs.</font>

1045
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:50,923
Anthony, what name have you
written down, please?

1046
00:48:50,963 --> 00:48:53,203
<font color="#00ff00">Well, I guess it's not going to</font>
<font color="#00ff00">be a surprise.</font>

1047
00:48:53,243 --> 00:48:55,243
<font color="#00ff00">My vote is for Diane.</font>

1048
00:48:55,283 --> 00:48:57,283
<font color="#00ff00">For somebody to coerce things</font>

1049
00:48:57,323 --> 00:49:02,123
<font color="#00ff00">and those type of attributes</font>
<font color="#00ff00">are attributes that</font>

1050
00:49:02,163 --> 00:49:02,283
<font color="#00ff00">and those type of attributes</font>
<font color="#00ff00">are attributes that</font>

1051
00:49:02,323 --> 00:49:04,563
<font color="#00ff00">I would associate with a Traitor</font>
<font color="#00ff00">trying to lead people.</font>

1052
00:49:04,603 --> 00:49:07,203
<font color="#00ff00">So, that's why my vote is for you,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Diane.</font>

1053
00:49:08,683 --> 00:49:11,163
Meg, who do you believe is a Traitor
and why?

1054
00:49:11,203 --> 00:49:13,083
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just going to go with Diane,</font>

1055
00:49:13,123 --> 00:49:17,283
<font color="#ffff00">but I hope you make me feel really</font>
<font color="#ffff00">stupid and that this vote is wrong.</font>

1056
00:49:18,683 --> 00:49:19,843
A vote count.

1057
00:49:19,883 --> 00:49:24,243
We have nine for Sonja,
two for Anthony, two for Diane,

1058
00:49:24,283 --> 00:49:26,923
one for Zack and one for Ross.

1059
00:49:29,323 --> 00:49:32,363
Evie, who have you written down?

1060
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:33,363
<font color="#00ff00">Sonja.</font>

1061
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:39,963
Brian.<font color="#ffff00">I think it's just down to bad</font>
<font color="#ffff00">decision-making on your...on</font>

1062
00:49:40,003 --> 00:49:41,443
<font color="#ffff00">your part, Sonja.</font>

1063
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,563
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry.</font>

1064
00:49:45,003 --> 00:49:46,003
Charlotte.

1065
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:48,163
<font color="#00ff00">You haven't convinced me</font>
<font color="#00ff00">that you're not a Traitor,</font>

1066
00:49:48,203 --> 00:49:49,723
<font color="#00ff00">so I voted for you, Sonja.</font>

1067
00:49:53,683 --> 00:49:58,443
<font color="#ffff00">I think this person is playing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a game at this moment in time.</font>

1068
00:49:58,483 --> 00:49:59,923
<font color="#ffff00">I think this person is playing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a game at this moment in time.</font>

1069
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,683
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, Sonja,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and I really hope I'm wrong.</font>

1070
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:04,203
<font color="#00ffff">I voted for you, Sonja.</font>

1071
00:50:08,643 --> 00:50:10,963
And for the final vote, Charlie.

1072
00:50:11,003 --> 00:50:15,203
<font color="#00ff00">I really hope you're a Traitor,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">because I think you're so lovely.</font>

1073
00:50:22,883 --> 00:50:25,283
Sonja,
you have received the most votes.

1074
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:27,043
Please come up and join me.

1075
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:30,883
# Hear the battle call

1076
00:50:30,923 --> 00:50:35,523
# Cities rise and empires fall

1077
00:50:35,563 --> 00:50:39,883
# But it's a war worth fighting... #

1078
00:50:41,283 --> 00:50:43,843
Sonja, you have been banished.

1079
00:50:45,683 --> 00:50:49,603
You can now reveal,
are you a Traitor or a Faithful?

1080
00:50:52,243 --> 00:50:56,843
<font color="#00ffff">Well, guys, facts are important to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">me as they obviously are to you, so</font>

1081
00:50:56,883 --> 00:50:57,363
<font color="#00ffff">Well, guys, facts are important to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">me as they obviously are to you, so</font>

1082
00:50:57,403 --> 00:51:02,203
<font color="#00ffff">here's a fact that I would now like</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to confirm to you,</font>

1083
00:51:02,243 --> 00:51:02,403
<font color="#00ffff">here's a fact that I would now like</font>
<font color="#00ffff">to confirm to you,</font>

1084
00:51:02,443 --> 00:51:03,803
<font color="#00ffff">and that is...</font>

1085
00:51:05,603 --> 00:51:07,603
<font color="#00ffff">..that I am...</font>

1086
00:51:07,643 --> 00:51:09,443
<font color="#00ffff">..a Faithful.</font> <font color="#ffff00">Yes!</font>

1087
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:18,123
# And we will keep on fighting

1088
00:51:18,163 --> 00:51:18,723
# And we will keep on fighting

1089
00:51:21,643 --> 00:51:26,203
# It's a war worth fighting

1090
00:51:29,283 --> 00:51:33,483
# It's a war worth fighting. #

1091
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:38,323
So, you just banished a really,
really smart Faithful.

1092
00:51:38,363 --> 00:51:39,123
So, you just banished a really,
really smart Faithful.

1093
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:44,363
You'll have another go tomorrow,
but before that,

1094
00:51:44,403 --> 00:51:45,883
somebody will be murdered.

1095
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:49,283
Sleep well.

1096
00:51:54,203 --> 00:51:56,003
<font color="#ffff00">I knew she was a Faithful.</font>

1097
00:51:56,043 --> 00:51:59,083
<font color="#ffff00">Absolutely gutted Sonja got</font>
<font color="#ffff00">banished.</font>

1098
00:51:59,123 --> 00:52:02,243
<font color="#00ffff">No, we just learned</font>
<font color="#00ffff">we need to communicate more, man.</font>

1099
00:52:02,283 --> 00:52:04,203
<font color="#00ff00">I think it's herd mentality, though.</font>

1100
00:52:04,243 --> 00:52:07,923
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know what, it's...I've</font>
<font color="#ffff00">gone off something that's happened.</font>

1101
00:52:07,963 --> 00:52:11,203
<font color="#00ffff">Same here.</font> <font color="#ffff00">That's all you can do.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">What else...what else did we have?</font>

1102
00:52:12,403 --> 00:52:14,923
<font color="#00ff00">I am devastated that there's two</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Faithfuls gone,</font>

1103
00:52:14,963 --> 00:52:17,283
<font color="#00ff00">but I was going on facts.</font>

1104
00:52:17,323 --> 00:52:20,643
<font color="#00ff00">Sonja made it quite easy for me</font>
<font color="#00ff00">to vote for her.</font>

1105
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:24,923
<font color="#00ff00">Jonny, he did a little switcheroo</font>
<font color="#00ff00">right at the end</font>

1106
00:52:24,963 --> 00:52:27,563
<font color="#00ff00">and I could see him, he was</font>
<font color="#00ff00">looking at me from across the table.</font>

1107
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,603
<font color="#00ff00">I'm going to have to keep</font>
<font color="#00ff00">an eye on him, I think.</font>

1108
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,963
<font color="#ffff00">No-one can physically have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">trust here,</font>

1109
00:52:42,003 --> 00:52:44,323
<font color="#ffff00">so that means the communication</font>
<font color="#ffff00">has to be double.</font>

1110
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:49,163
<font color="#00ffff">She wasn't a Traitor,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but you acted as if he was.</font> <font color="#00ff00">Yes.</font>

1111
00:52:49,203 --> 00:52:50,283
<font color="#00ffff">And that was the problem.</font>

1112
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:52,923
<font color="#ffff00">I think obviously she was too</font>
<font color="#ffff00">intelligent for her own good.</font>

1113
00:52:52,963 --> 00:52:55,203
<font color="#00ffff">It's the way she acted.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I feel really bad.</font>

1114
00:52:58,163 --> 00:52:59,683
<font color="#ffff00">I was so convinced she wasn't...</font>

1115
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:01,363
<font color="#00ffff">I was so convinced she was.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">..a Traitor</font>

1116
00:53:01,403 --> 00:53:03,923
<font color="#ffff00">that I thought, "Do you know what,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just going to say it,"</font>

1117
00:53:03,963 --> 00:53:06,723
<font color="#ffff00">so I said it and then of course when</font>
<font color="#ffff00">she was a Faithful, I went, "Yes!"</font>

1118
00:53:06,763 --> 00:53:09,243
<font color="#ffff00">But that's awful...</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font> <font color="#ffff00">..because</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it would have been a lot better if</font>

1119
00:53:09,283 --> 00:53:11,483
<font color="#ffff00">she'd been a Traitor.</font> <font color="#00ffff">It weren't</font>
<font color="#00ffff">the best move.</font>

1120
00:53:11,523 --> 00:53:12,923
<font color="#ffff00">No, it wasn't, and I am sorry.</font>

1121
00:53:12,963 --> 00:53:15,243
<font color="#ffff00">I had got myself so worked up,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I was going...</font>

1122
00:53:15,283 --> 00:53:16,363
SHARP INTAKE OF BREATH

1123
00:53:16,403 --> 00:53:19,043
<font color="#ffff00">..because I believe absolutely</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that she's Faithful,</font>

1124
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:23,123
<font color="#ffff00">and as everybody was writing down</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and going for her,</font>

1125
00:53:23,163 --> 00:53:25,683
<font color="#ffff00">I thought, "You've got this so</font>
<font color="#ffff00">wrong."</font>

1126
00:53:25,723 --> 00:53:28,843
<font color="#00ffff">I know she was a Faithful, but,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, babe,</font>

1127
00:53:28,883 --> 00:53:30,043
<font color="#00ffff">she wasn't a very good one,</font>

1128
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:32,963
<font color="#00ffff">because like, I don't understand why</font>
<font color="#00ffff">she was doing all that.</font>

1129
00:53:33,003 --> 00:53:35,803
<font color="#00ff00">But she's a clever lady...</font> <font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">..and I just think</font>

1130
00:53:35,843 --> 00:53:39,123
<font color="#00ff00">she just thought that none of you</font>
<font color="#00ff00">would ever think she was a Traitor.</font>

1131
00:53:46,563 --> 00:53:49,203
<font color="#ffff00">I haven't really warmed to Diane,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">or she hasn't warmed to me.</font>

1132
00:53:49,243 --> 00:53:52,403
<font color="#ffff00">She looks at me all the time.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I think, "Is she being suspicious?"</font>

1133
00:53:52,443 --> 00:53:53,803
<font color="#00ffff">I have this weird theory.</font>

1134
00:53:53,843 --> 00:53:56,723
<font color="#00ffff">I think there's a mum</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and a child here.</font>

1135
00:53:56,763 --> 00:53:58,403
<font color="#ffff00">Do you?</font>

1136
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,643
<font color="#00ffff">And I think it's Diane and Paul.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Do you think?</font>

1137
00:54:00,683 --> 00:54:02,963
<font color="#00ffff">Well, with Diane, when she came</font>
<font color="#00ffff">straight out for Anthony,</font>

1138
00:54:03,003 --> 00:54:04,963
<font color="#00ffff">right out the gates.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I just did not see that coming.</font>

1139
00:54:05,003 --> 00:54:06,523
<font color="#00ffff">I think she's real, I think she's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">cunning,</font>

1140
00:54:06,563 --> 00:54:07,803
<font color="#00ffff">I think she's quite intelligent.</font>

1141
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:09,443
<font color="#00ffff">I think, er, she's someone's mum.</font>

1142
00:54:10,363 --> 00:54:13,083
# Some may say

1143
00:54:13,123 --> 00:54:15,603
<font color="#ffff00"># May say</font>

1144
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:19,123
# I'm wishing my days away

1145
00:54:19,163 --> 00:54:21,003
# No way... #

1146
00:54:26,243 --> 00:54:28,443
<font color="#ffff00">I was just, like, well, I was</font>
<font color="#ffff00">like...</font>

1147
00:54:28,483 --> 00:54:30,043
BELL CHIMES

1148
00:54:31,123 --> 00:54:32,323
<font color="#ffff00">OK, that's our...</font>

1149
00:54:33,443 --> 00:54:37,883
The chimes of the castle clock
signal the murdering hour is near.

1150
00:54:37,923 --> 00:54:38,483
The chimes of the castle clock
signal the murdering hour is near.

1151
00:54:38,523 --> 00:54:39,803
<font color="#00ffff">You take care.</font> <font color="#00ff00">Bye, Harry.</font>

1152
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,363
<font color="#00ffff">I'll, fingers crossed,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">see you tomorrow, hopefully.</font>

1153
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:45,403
<font color="#ffff00">Goodnight. I hope none of us</font>
<font color="#ffff00">get killed.</font>

1154
00:54:49,283 --> 00:54:51,683
It's time for the Traitors to return

1155
00:54:51,723 --> 00:54:55,883
and decide which Faithful will be
murdered by moonlight.

1156
00:54:58,043 --> 00:55:01,603
# We could live together

1157
00:55:01,643 --> 00:55:06,563
# Walking on, walking on the
moon... #

1158
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:07,523
# Walking on, walking on the
moon... #

1159
00:55:15,723 --> 00:55:17,963
<font color="#ffff00">Ah! Hello, everyone.</font>

1160
00:55:18,003 --> 00:55:20,123
<font color="#ffff00">Good evening.</font> <font color="#00ffff">That was amazing.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Wowee!</font>

1161
00:55:20,163 --> 00:55:21,763
<font color="#00ff00">Paul, straight away, great effort.</font>

1162
00:55:21,803 --> 00:55:24,083
<font color="#00ff00">If we can get a Shield, that's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">just perfect.</font>

1163
00:55:24,123 --> 00:55:26,643
<font color="#ffff00">See, I passed the blame onto Andrew.</font>

1164
00:55:26,683 --> 00:55:27,963
<font color="#00ff00">Perfectly as well.</font>

1165
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:29,963
<font color="#ffff00">And in the chats afterwards as well,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I thought,</font>

1166
00:55:30,003 --> 00:55:31,363
<font color="#ffff00">"Our names aren't coming up."</font>

1167
00:55:31,403 --> 00:55:33,523
<font color="#00ffff">Well...</font> <font color="#00ff00">I do have to say about Ash.</font>

1168
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:36,243
<font color="#00ff00">Yeah, I've heard your name</font>
<font color="#00ff00">quite a few times.</font>

1169
00:55:36,283 --> 00:55:38,763
<font color="#00ff00">Diane said to me that she</font>

1170
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:43,243
<font color="#00ff00">believed that you move around the</font>
<font color="#00ff00">castle, like, really weird.</font>

1171
00:55:43,283 --> 00:55:45,243
<font color="#ffff00">The thing is, though...</font>
<font color="#00ffff">That's bizarre.</font>

1172
00:55:45,283 --> 00:55:47,923
<font color="#ffff00">Diane now has no allies. Tracey.</font>

1173
00:55:47,963 --> 00:55:50,123
<font color="#00ff00">Diane will banish herself.</font>

1174
00:55:50,163 --> 00:55:51,443
<font color="#ffff00">So who's on the list?</font>

1175
00:55:51,483 --> 00:55:54,603
<font color="#00ffff">Who's got a big influence, then?</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Kyra's got a massive...</font>

1176
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:57,283
<font color="#00ffff">..she, she's definitely</font>
<font color="#00ffff">one to watch.</font>

1177
00:55:57,323 --> 00:56:00,123
<font color="#00ff00">If she flips on you,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">you're in big trouble.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Exactly.</font>

1178
00:56:00,163 --> 00:56:01,483
<font color="#ffff00">And unpredictable.</font> <font color="#00ffff">Yeah.</font>

1179
00:56:01,523 --> 00:56:04,523
<font color="#ffff00">And she has so much power in</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that room.</font>

1180
00:56:04,563 --> 00:56:05,803
<font color="#00ff00">She has a big voice.</font>

1181
00:56:05,843 --> 00:56:07,723
<font color="#00ff00">She doesn't really let anyone</font>
<font color="#00ff00">else get a word in.</font>

1182
00:56:07,763 --> 00:56:09,443
<font color="#ffff00">I think she's a big voice,</font>

1183
00:56:09,483 --> 00:56:11,603
<font color="#ffff00">but I don't know how many people</font>
<font color="#ffff00">listen to her.</font>

1184
00:56:11,643 --> 00:56:15,083
<font color="#00ff00">I really feel like we should flip</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the table, as in, like,</font>

1185
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:17,923
<font color="#00ff00">really random, someone like Jonny.</font>

1186
00:56:17,963 --> 00:56:18,963
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my God.</font>

1187
00:56:19,003 --> 00:56:21,083
<font color="#00ff00">So, I also feel like that will lead</font>
<font color="#00ff00">everyone to Ross.</font>

1188
00:56:21,123 --> 00:56:22,563
<font color="#ffff00">Well, this is the thing.</font>

1189
00:56:22,603 --> 00:56:24,323
<font color="#00ff00">He said about it today,</font>

1190
00:56:24,363 --> 00:56:26,523
<font color="#00ff00">"If it's not Sonja, I'm going to be</font>
<font color="#00ff00">watching you."</font>

1191
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:28,683
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think anybody</font>
<font color="#ffff00">would banish him.</font>

1192
00:56:28,723 --> 00:56:30,723
<font color="#00ffff">The name I thought of was Meg...</font>

1193
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:34,483
<font color="#00ffff">..because she threw out a random.</font>

1194
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:36,683
<font color="#00ffff">I didn't expect her to</font>
<font color="#00ffff">go for Diane at all.</font>

1195
00:56:36,723 --> 00:56:41,123
<font color="#00ffff">If Meg is murdered, it would kind</font>
<font color="#00ffff">of double down on that narrative,</font>

1196
00:56:41,163 --> 00:56:41,883
<font color="#00ffff">If Meg is murdered, it would kind</font>

1197
00:56:41,923 --> 00:56:43,003
<font color="#00ffff">so to speak.</font>

1198
00:56:45,843 --> 00:56:48,723
# Ah-ah-ah... #

1199
00:56:48,763 --> 00:56:51,123
<font color="#ffff00">So, guys, it's going to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">be between</font>

1200
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:53,483
<font color="#ffff00">Jonny,</font>

1201

<font color="#ffff00">Meg</font>

1202
00:56:55,283 --> 00:56:57,443
<font color="#ffff00">and Kyra.</font>
